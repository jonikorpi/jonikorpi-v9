  # What I'm currently working on
    
  **Bringing zoomable user interfaces to the web.** I've been working on _ZUIs_ and other alternative UIs, like _infinite canvas systems_ and _[bi-directional layouts](/bi-directional-layout/)_, since 2012.
  
  **Attempting game development on the web.** I'm especially interested in coming up with more _sustainable_ models for large-scale multiplayer games (something like using P2P instead of a central server), but I have no idea what I'm doing.
  
  **Designing VR/AR concepts.** They're obviously the current big thing. The idea of moving away from glowing rectangles intrigues me.
