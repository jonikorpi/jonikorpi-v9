  # What I'm currently working on.
    
  I'm working through my company, [Vuoro](http://vuoro.design/), creating games and the occasional app on the web. My focus is on learning to use 3D, VR and large-scale multiplayer systems while getting ready for AR.
  
  I'm also doing some contract work. Right now my contract work schedule is mostly taken up by projects at [Kisko](https://www.kiskolabs.com/), but feel free to contact me below if you're interested in hiring me.
  
  # How to contact me.
