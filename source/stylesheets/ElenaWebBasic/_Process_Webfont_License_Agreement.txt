PROCESS TYPE FOUNDRY, LLC
WEBFONT LICENSE AGREEMENT
--------------------------------
This License Agreement ("Agreement" or "License") is a legal contract between you and the Process Type Foundry, LLC ("Process"). When you purchase a license to use the Process font software ("Font" or "Font Software" or "Webfonts"), you are purchasing the right to use that font under the terms and conditions identified in this License. It is important that you read and understand this Agreement because it defines your rights, the acceptable uses of our Webfonts, and the rights Process reserves. If you believe your usage or need is not addressed, or if you are unsure of any meaning of any term or condition, please ask us before you make a purchase.

Once you download and/or use the Process Webfonts, you are confirming you understand and agree to the terms of this Agreement, and that you have the authority to bind the person or entity specified on your sales receipt to the terms of this Agreement. Upon payment in full, the Process Type Foundry grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use our Webfonts under the following terms and conditions.


------------
DEFINITIONS
------------	
1a.) "Webfont" is defined as type face font software that has been created, optimized, translated or otherwise modified for use by means of transmitting via the Internet for use in the viewing of text on a website. By way of explanation, not limitation, such uses can be implemented by means of the CSS @font-face rule. Other technology or software implementations used to effect similar results may apply and such uses or methods shall be governed by this License.

1b.) "Primary Domain", "Subdomain", "Domain". A Primary Domain is the host name of a website's home page (for example, not limitation: example.com; example.co.uk; example.org; user.example.com; www.example.com/~user/; etc.). A Subdomain is a subdivision of the Primary Domain (for example, not limitation: shop.example.com; support.example.com; or user.example.com; etc.). Primary Domains together with their associated Subdomains are referred to collectively and defined as "Domains".

1c.) "You", "Your" and the "End User" are defined as and refer to a customer who has purchased a license to use the Webfonts and is responsible for creating, placing and/or managing the content on the licensed Domains. An End User is not defined as a distributor, reseller, dealer, sub-licensee, original equipment manufacturer ("OEM"), server administrator or other wholesale buyer, etc. If you are a designer, part of a creative agency, or otherwise acting in a similar capacity for the benefit of a third party and you will not be in control of the Webfont's hosting environment and the content on the licensed Domains, the purchase of a Webfont license for your client or the end user is required. Process Type Foundry products may not be distributed and/or sold to third parties without prior written consent from Process.

-----------------------------------
2. PERMITTED USES AND RESTRICTIONS
-----------------------------------
2a.) IMPLEMENTATION
The Webfonts are provided to You for use via the CSS @font-face rule. You agree not to use the Webfonts by any other means and/or methods of storage, transmission or viewing and that You will use the Webfont files, in the format provided to You by Process. Use of the Webfonts in alternative formats not provided by Process is expressly prohibited.

2b.) ALLOWED DOMAINS
The Process Webfont license is provided in two (2) basic forms: 
 
    2b.i.) A "Single Domain" license permits the Webfonts to be served for the benefit of one (1) Primary Domain and five (5) Subdomains. 

    2b.ii.) An "Up to 10 Domains" license permits the Webfonts to be served for the benefit of a maximum of ten (10) Primary Domains with each Primary Domain allowed to serve an additional five (5) related Subdomains. 
    
Review Your sales receipt to understand which license You purchased. Use of the Webfonts on more than the licensed Domains requires a license extension for which an additional fee will be charged. For the purposes of clarity, this License does not permit the Webfonts to be used in such a way as to serve the Webfonts to unlicensed domains. Regardless of whether the Webfonts are hosted on licensed Domains, the Webfonts may not be served for the benefit of unlicensed Domains.

2c.) WEBFONTS FILE PROTECTION
You agree to take reasonable measures to ensure the Webfonts are available only for the process of styling text for display on Your licensed Domains. At a minimum, and by way of illustration not limitation, reasonable measures include a.) preventing unlicensed third-party access, i.e. hotlinking and b.) disallowing direct download of the Webfonts unrelated to the process of styling text for licensed Domains. 

2d.) THIRD PARTY HOSTS
At Your option, the Webfonts may be hosted and served by a Process-approved third party.  Under such circumstances you expressly agree the terms and conditions of this License shall govern all uses of the Webfonts irrespective of any competing or contrary terms set forth by any third party hosting the Webfonts. A list of Process-approved hosts can be obtained by contacting Process directly.

2e.) BACK-UP COPIES
You may make a reasonable number of copies of the Webfonts for back-up purposes only. Any copies must contain the same documentation, copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices that appear on, in or with the Webfonts. 

2f.) NO MODIFICATIONS, NO EMBEDDING
Under no circumstances are You permitted to copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, alter or attempt to discover the source code of the Webfonts or the designs embodied therein. This includes changing file name of the Webfont. The embedding of Process Webfonts or the designs of the fonts thereof in other software, digital documents, applications or devices or in any other form whatsoever is prohibited. 

2g.) WEB USAGE ONLY
This license does not cover the use of Process Webfonts on a desktop, laptop, or workstation computer or for any use other than as expressly permitted herein. If You wish to use the Webfonts in a manner not permitted by this license, You must secure a separate license and/or a license extension by contacting Process directly.

4c.) Other law, Non-Business Users Only. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or special damages, or implied warranties.
